0) See if I can assign a random shade of red to all amino acids. 
	- Seems like I can map a particular amino acid to particular shade of red
	- Figure out how to do actual shade of red through converting hex to decimal 
	- Figure out how to get the index mapping to color rather than amino acid to color

1) Got to figure out how to get proper residue indexes from amino acid in pdb 
to that used internally by pv

2) I will have data for each uniprot pdb, with indices mapped to some floating 
point representing the frequency of snp variation 
(ie 120 = 0.33, 121 = 0.1, 124 = 0.4, ... resid = freq)
Goal is to assign color as [freq, 0, 0] cvec representation of color. Effectively
I will just be assigning the red channel as the frequency value.

- Figured out how to create white to red gradient in the 4 number notation
	- 1,1,1,1 is white, 1, 0,0,1 is red. 1, 0.05*i, 0.05*i, 1 is the gradient

- Need to figure out how to accurately get the residue indexing working. Once that is
good then everything should work. Read in a json dictionary mapping residue position
to snp variation freq. This frequency will be binned to the 20 categories of "redness"
to get the actual color encoding. 

TODO:
- Figure out how to get the indexing for pdb input working properly. Maybe explore selection?

- The residue indices match, now get the data for snp frequencies.
