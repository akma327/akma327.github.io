- Need to generate a dictionary table mapping uniprot to the snp information for all class A 
gpcr uniprots. 
- Might revamp another table to channel uniprot to pdb to use (for ones with crystal structure
use the original from PDB, otherwise use GPCRDB models)

- Have one dictionary mapping from uniprot --> snps (this basically just involves processing the 
file AJ gave me)
- Have second dictionary mapping from uniprot to pdb
- Have third dictionary mapping from uniprot to gpcrdb models (only for ones that don't have real PDB)

Query Processing:
- User clicks one of the page
- uniprot retrieved
- If in pdb dict then get pdb, also get snps
- If not in pdb dict then get modeled pdb, also get snps
